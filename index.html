                <b>Combined Arms</b> is a modpack/setting/server for minecraft focused around the emergence of the atomic age.
                While the factions and events in the story are based on real-life equivalents, they aren't intended to be historically accurate.
                <br><br>
                The main stage is the Pacific island chain of Berilia, a formerly neglected corner of the world that had been found to hold high quantities of uranium ore.
                A Great War had been raging for several decades between the world's great powers, with seemingly no end in sight; A few months before present day
                the first prototype nuclear bomb was detonated near the front lines, bringing a moment of pause and a partial ceasefire across the board.
                Before long the great powers realised the source of the explosion, and immediately began scrambling to assemble a nuclear arsenal for themselves.
                Countless began flooding to Berilia and other similar territories to harvest and export the uranium buried there.

            <p>
                The modpack is mainly based around the Create mod, with weapons and ammunition being produced via Create mechanisms, though there are alternative means to aquiring most items.
                Both Wandering Traders and Pillagers have been overhauled, with Wandering Traders offering supplies and loot cases in exchange for uranium crates,
                and Pillagers becoming bandits or rival prospectors, with modern fortresses that can be raided for munitions.
                <br>
                The mods Just Enough Guns, Create Big Cannons, Trackwork, Eureka, CBC: Nuclear, and Immersive Aircraft are some of the main content mods that allow players to create firearms,
                artillery, tanks, battleships, biplanes, and nuclear weapons.

                <br><br>
                There are also mods for more strategic purposes, such as adding radio systems, film cameras, simple computers, oil distillation and electrical systems.
                The Continents and Geophilic mods modify world generation, favouring large oceans and continents, making sailing more viable and increasing pressure to stay near the spawn continent.

                <br><br>
