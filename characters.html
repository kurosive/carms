            <h2>Allegiance</h2>
            <p>
                While not mandatory, it is recommended that characters are aligned with or at least from one of the several pre-written factions.
                The factions with a vested interest in Berilia are:
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>The NSCU</h3>
            For the NSCU, a nuclear arsenal would provide a great deterrent for invasion, while also ensuring the security of their economic zone.
            <br>
            Volunteer soldiers trying to avoid the front lines and convicts offered a chance at freedom are the most common nationals found travelling to Berilia.
            <br><br>

            <h3>The Riesen Empire</h3>
            A significant stockpile of Uranium could be used as a strong bargaining chip to end the war, or alternatively, an essential weapon in prolonging it.
            <br>
            Small squads with their sergeants are sent after going through training, often alongside a hired UVR or Denshiman convoy.
            <br><br>

            <h3>The Eastern Union</h3>
            A nuclear stockpile would help legitimise the union in the eyes of the other Great Powers, and help to secure the Eastern Union's position as a global superpower in the coming years.
            <br>
            Soldiers are selected by lottery and given additional training before being sent to Berilia.
            <br><br>

            <h3>The Denshima Empire</h3>
            Nuclear weapons would give a significant advantage in the Denshima Empire's conquest of the Pacific, and function as a deterrent against the UVR.
            <br>
            Most Denshiman migrants are civilian contractors, brought to Berilia via a navy convoy, and often aided by marines.
            <br><br>

            <h3>The UVR</h3>
            With their growing dominance over the global economy, nuclear weapons are considered essential to protect the UVR's interests.
            <br>
            While most travellers are contracted mercenaries, the UVR also has the highest civilian percentage migrating to Berilia.
            <br><br>

            <p>
                Of course characters do not necessarily need to be from these five, they may be from any of the <a href="./powers.html" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 204);">Great Powers and nations available</a>, as well as any unmentioned nations. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Characters should have one or more motivations for being in Berilia, some examples include:
                <br><br>
                <ul style="padding-left: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
                    <li>Prospecting for Uranium on behalf of a faction</li>
                    <li>Prospecting for Uranium for personal gain</li>
                    <li>Intending to sell/trade supplies</li>
                    <li>To sabotage an enemy faction's production</li>
                    <li>To escape a debt or punishment in their homeland</li>
                    <li>Being shipwrecked there</li>
                    <li>To settle/seize territory in an ungoverned land</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Another option, while unlikely, is that a character may already be living in Berilia before the story's events.<br>
                In this case, or similar, they may decide to:
                <br><br>
                <ul style="padding-left: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
                    <li>Resist occupation from outside powers</li>
                    <li>Seize assets and form governed territories</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
